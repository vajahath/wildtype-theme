# Wildtype

## About

Wildtype is a dark theme with calm, earthy colors contrasted with deep, dark blues.

"Wildtype" is a play on [wild type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type) (the typical form of a species as it occurs in nature).

This theme works well across many different languages and was originally put together for JavaScript and TypeScript development. Feel free to contribute if something can improve.
